## A Little About Me

- I live in the **East Village** NY, NY 🗽🏢

- I'm a full time **computer science** student studying at **UC San Diego**. 📚🏫

- I specialize in **full stack web development**, but i'm always looking for new topics to sink my teeth in! 💾💻

- I'm also an avid **music lover and musician**, so if you're looking for new music i'm sure i could find u something!  🎸🎧

## Projects

```js
  const project_names = ['ucwh', 'tezan', 'stock_trading_bot']
  project_names.map(name => {
    console.log(name);
  })
```

Over the past few years I've dabbled and worked on a number of little projects but here and there, but here are a few that I'm most proud of

1. [Tezan Records](https://tezanrecords.com)

> While I love software engineering, I am just as passionate about music and the music industry. Tezan Records is a **community of artists** that will eventually have a centralized, in-house production, engineering, marketing, and advertisement capabilities. I developed both the front end and back end of the website using **Next JS, PostgreSQL, and AWS RDS**.

2. [Stock Trading Algorithm](https://github.com/JoshDreben/overnight_algo)

> Over the course of quarantine I became interested in various areas in data science, one of them being algorithmic trading. This particular project is a (marginally successful) **trading bot** that interfaces with the **Alpaca Trading API** and utilizes **Pandas** and **Numpy** to implement an "overnight hold" algorithm.

3. [UC Woodland Hills](https://ucwh.wtf)

> Also over quarantine, I wanted to find new ways to keep me and my friends connected in entertaining ways, so I came up with the concept of a parody college website named after my city where my friends can apply through a funny application process to become a "student" at **UC Woodland Hills**. I developed the website using **React, Redux, MongoDB, and Express JS.**
